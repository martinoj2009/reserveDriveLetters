This is a PowerShell script for Windows systems. This will allow you to specify certain drive letters in an array.
The script will then look at locally atteched drives (NOT NETWORKED) drives and mark them for change.
This was written to reserve network drives.

You need at least PowerShell version 4.0. If you don't have it you need to download the Windows Managment Framework 4.
